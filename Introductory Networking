This week I completed the following module Introductory to Networking. I completed this on Tryhackme.com. We went over several different layers of the OSI model and briefly learned what each layer does. I learned that every layer does something different but works together as a team when you link them up similar to the post office mail system. I learned the importance of encapsulation and decapsulation. This means that all transmissions will consistently follow the same methodology, allowing any network-enabled device to send a request to any other reachable device and be sure that it will be understood. I learned about the TCP/ICP model which is generally broken down into five layers. The purpose of the TCP/ICP model is to communicate with the networks and this model functions similarly to the OSI Model.
