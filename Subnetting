The entire purpose of the Subnet Mask is to show the computer where to separate the IP Address into the Network ID and the Host ID. When read in Binary, a Subnet Mask will always be a string of 1's followed by a string of 0's. The 1's cover the Network ID while the 0's cover the Host ID. The IP Address is separated between the last 1 and the first 0.
TCP/IP addresses are made up of 4 sets of numbers called "Octets." Each octet is an 8 bit binary string. The easiest and fastest way to determine the number of valid Hosts, Networks, or Subnets, is to count the number of bits (single space digits in Binary) in that ID, figure out the largest possible number (remembering not to use all 1's) and translate that back to decimal. For example: an address with 5 bits dedicated to the Host ID (11110) would have 30 different possible Hosts. This method works to calculate the number of Networks or Subnets as well. Subnetting is used to break a class network into a number of smaller groups of Hosts called a Subnet. For example: a Class "B" network by default has 65,534 Hosts (16 spaces 1111111111111110.) we can break a standard Class "B" network into 30 Subnets each containing 2046 Hosts.
207.119.87.43 = IP Address
255.255.248.0 = Subnet Mask
